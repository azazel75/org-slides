* Overview
This repository contains emacs lisp files providing HTML slideshow
export and publishing options for the new org-mode export framework. 
The latest org-mode is available for checkout at
=git://orgmode.org/org-mode.git=, and includes these classes in the
=contrib/lisp= directory (note that the versions included there may be
older than those in this repository.)

* The Exporters
** ox-deck.el
This will export/publish an org outline (or subtree) to a [[http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/][deck.js]] slideshow.
*** Installation
1. Get a copy of [[http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/][deck.js]] from [[http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/]] or
   the github repositiory at
   [[https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js]].
2. Customize the variable =org-deck-directories= to include the path
   to the directory created in (1) above. This is required to
   automatically identify available deck components (extensions,
   themes and transitions).
3. The exporter will create links to the themes, transitions and
   extensions relative to the customization variable
   =org-deck-base-url=.
*** Customization
 The method =org-deck-list-components=, will list all the available
 extensions, themes and transitions in the directories included in
 =org-deck-directories=.

The following variables (in the customization group =org-export-deck=)
are available to customize the slideshow generation:

| option                      | in buffer option        | publishing option        | default   |
|-----------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+-----------|
| org-deck-base-url           | DECK_BASE_URL           | :deck-base-url           | deck.js   |
| org-deck-theme              | DECK_THEME              | :deck-theme              | swiss.css |
| org-deck-transition         | DECK_TRANSITION         | :deck-transition         | fade.css  |
| org-deck-include-extensions | DECK_INCLUDE_EXTENSIONS | :deck-include-extensions | {all}     |
| org-deck-exclude-extensions | DECK_EXCLUDE_EXTENSIONS | :deck-exclude-extensions |           |
| org-deck-directories        |                         |                          | ./deck.js |
*** Using "builds"
[[http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/][deck.js]] creates "builds" through nested slides --- any block level
element with the class "slide" will be treated as a build. The
exporter has two ways to accomplish this:

1. Set the =:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS= property on a headline to a string
   including =slide=.
2. To build a list, set the =:STEP= property on the enclosing
   headline to =t=.
*** Generating HTML5 compatible slideshows
Standard org outlines are generated as XHTML 1.0 compatible
documents. The "standard" for [[http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/][deck.js]] is HTML5. The latest version of
the org exporter will allow you to modify the output as follows. By
modifying  the following options/variable:

| option                     | in buffer option | publishing option | value                                                                                          |
|----------------------------+------------------+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| org-html-container-element | HTML_CONTAINER   | :html-container   | section                                                                                        |
| org-html-doctype           | HTML_DOCTYPE     | :html-doctype     | <!DOCTYPE html>                                                                                |
| org-html-divs              |                  |                   | ((preamble "header" "preamble") (content "article" "content") (postamble "footer" "postamble)) |

Note that =org-html-divs= cannot be set with a customization or
in-buffer option, but must be set with a BIND or local variable.
** ox-s5.el
This will export/publish an org outline (or subtree) to an [[http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/][s5]]
slideshow.
*** Installation
1. Get a copy of the [[http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/][s5]] scripts from
   [[http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/]].
2. The exporter will create links to the javscript file and the
   generic stylesheets in the default directory under =:s5-ui-url=
   (=org-s5-ui-url=).
*** Customization
The following variables (in the customization group =org-export-s5=)
are available to customize the slideshow generation:

| customization variable    | in buffer option      | publishing option      | default   |
|---------------------------+-----------------------+------------------------+-----------|
| org-s5-version            | S5_VERSION            | :s5-version            | 1.2a2     |
| org-s5-theme-file         | S5_THEME_FILE         | :s5-theme-file         |           |
| org-s5-ui-url             | S5_UI_URL             | :s5-ui-url             | ui        |
| org-s5-default-view       | S5_DEFAULT_VIEW       | :s5-default-view       | slideshow |
| org-s5-control-visibility | S5_CONTROL_VISIBILITY | :s5-control-visibility | hidden    |

Note that if the =:s5-theme-file= is =nil=, it will use the file
=default/screen.css= relative to =:s5-ui-url=.
*** Using "builds"
 [[http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/][s5]] creates "builds" by including the class =incremental= on a
 headline or list (=ul= or =ol=). You can set the
 =HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS= property on a headline to "incremental",  to
 make it build. To make a list build, set the =INCREMENTAL= property
 on the parent headline to =t=.
*** Generating XOXO style slideshows
XOXO style slideshows (see [[http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/xoxo-structure-ref.html][S5 (XOXO Version)]]) can be generated
by setting the =org-html-container-element= to =li=. This can be done
in a number of ways as show in the table above under
[[#generating-html5-compatible-slideshows][Generating HTML5 compatible slideshows]].
* deck.js extension
onepage is a [[http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/][deck.js]] exension which, logically, will display a deck.js
slideshow as a single scrolling page. It can be toggled with the 'o'
key, and will print with slides separated by rule instead of one
slide per page.
