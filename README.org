* Overview
This repository contains emacs lisp files providing HTML slideshow
export and publishing options for the new org-mode export framework. 
The latest org-mode is available for checkout at
=git://orgmode.org/org-mode.git=, and includes these classes in the
=contrib/lisp= directory (note that the versions included there may be
older than those in this repository.)

* The Exporters
** ox-deck.el
This will export/publish an org outline (or subtree) to a [[http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/][deck.js]] slideshow.
*** Installation
1. Get a copy of [[http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/][deck.js]] from [[http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/]] or
   the github repositiory at
   [[https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js]].
2. Customize the variable =org-deck-directories= to include the path
   to the directory created in (1) above. This is required to
   automatically identify available deck components (extensions,
   themes and transitions).
3. The exporter will create links to the themes, transitions and
   extensions relative to the customization variable
   =org-deck-base-url=.
*** Customization
 The method =org-deck-list-components=, will list all the available
 extensions, themes and transitions in the directories included in
 =org-deck-directories=.

The following variables (in the customization group =org-export-deck=)
are available to customize the slideshow generation:

| customization variable      | in buffer option        | publishing option        | default   |
|-----------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+-----------|
| org-deck-base-url           | DECK_BASE_URL           | :deck-base-url           | deck.js   |
| org-deck-theme              | DECK_THEME              | :deck-theme              | swiss.css |
| org-deck-transition         | DECK_TRANSITION         | :deck-transition         | fade.css  |
| org-deck-include-extensions | DECK_INCLUDE_EXTENSIONS | :deck-include-extensions | {all}     |
| org-deck-exclude-extensions | DECK_EXCLUDE_EXTENSIONS | :deck-exclude-extensions |           |
| org-deck-directories        | DECK_DIRECTORIES        | :deck-directories        |           |
*** Using "builds"
[[http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/][deck.js]] creates "builds" through nested slides --- any block level
element with the class "slide" will be treated as a build. The
exporter has two ways to accomplish this:

1. Set the =:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS= property on a headline to a string
   including =slide=.
2. To build a list, set the =:STEP= property on the enclosing
   headline to =t=.

** ox-s5.el
This will export/publish an org outline (or subtree) to an [[http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/][s5]]
slideshow.
*** Installation
1. Get a copy of the [[http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/][s5]] scripts from
   [[http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/]].
2. 
*** Customization
The following variables (in the customization group =org-export-s5=)
are available to customize the slideshow generation:

| customization variable    | in buffer option      | publishing option      | default   |
|---------------------------+-----------------------+------------------------+-----------|
| org-s5-version            | S5_VERSION            | :s5-version            | 1.2a2     |
| org-s5-theme-file         | S5_THEME_FILE         | :s5-theme-file         |           |
| org-s5-ui-url             | S5_UI_URL             | :s5-ui-url             | ui        |
| org-s5-default-view       | S5_DEFAULT_VIEW       | :s5-default-view       | slideshow |
| org-s5-control-visibility | S5_CONTROL_VISIBILITY | :s5-control-visibility | hidden    |

Note that if the =:s5-theme-file= is =nil=, it will use the file
=default/screen.css= relative to =:s5-ui-url=.
*** Using "builds"
 [[http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/][s5]] creates "builds" by including the class =incremental= on a
 list (=ul= or =ol=). The exporter will apply this class to any list
 whose parent headline has the property =:INCREMENTAL=
